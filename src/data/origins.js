NASA’s WMAP satellite stitched together this full-sky image, giving us a \"baby photo\" of the cosmos that underpins modern models of cosmic inflation, dark matter, and dark energy."

Its daring anatomy, sculptural bodies, and negative-space lightning bolt of potential redefined Renaissance art, making the ceiling a manifesto of humankind’s god-like creative power."

The rough sketch captures a radical idea: species share common ancestry and diverge over time. That deceptively simple doodle grew into *On the Origin of Species* and forever changed biology."

The chunky flakes hint at a dawn moment when imagination met manual skill and technology was born."
